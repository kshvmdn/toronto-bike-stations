## Toronto Bike Stations
An implementation of the Bike Share Toronto open data.

### Update

__Dec. 6, 2016__ - It looks like [Bike Share Toronto](https://www.bikesharetoronto.com/) is featuring their own version of this ([link](https://member.bikesharetoronto.com/stations)). It seems to be identical to this one, so this project is _kind of_ useless at this point.

### Usage

  - Clone project:

  ```sh
  $ git clone https://github.com/kshvmdn/toronto-bike-stations
  ```
  
  - Install dependencies:
  
  ```sh
  $ npm install && bower install
  ```
  
  - Start the server. Find the map at `localhost:3000/map`.
  
  ```sh
  $ npm start
  ```
